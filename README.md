# Project 0 - Tic-Tac-Toe

The object of Tic-Tac-Toe is to have three of your symbols make a straight line. The line can go sideways, up and down, or diagonally. The first player to make a straight line with three of their symbols wins! If nobody has a straight line of three symbols when the grid is filled, it's a tie!

A special thanks to **CJ**, **Joel**, **Mark**, and **Tina** without whom the project couldn't have been completed. My mom and dad, who are thousands of kilometers away and have no clue as to what I'm doing and to my partner who hasn't complained once fot the past few weeks as I sit in front of the computer day and night.
