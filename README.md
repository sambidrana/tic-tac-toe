# Project 0 - Tic-Tac-Toe

The object of Tic-Tac-Toe is to have three of your symbols make a straight line. The line can go sideways, up and down, or diagonally. The first player to make a straight line with three of their symbols wins! If nobody has a straight line of three symbols when the grid is filled, it's a tie!
